## Tableau Instructions:

   Tableau Desktop needs to be purchased, but if you have a student email address you can access this product for free for 1 year. If this applies to you, make an account [here](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students). Once you have done that, download the software. After that, you can begin adding data and creating visualizations!
   
   **Note:** If you need a license to simply *view* and not *create*, you need **Tableau Reader**. This will give you access to open and view .twbx files.
   * [Download Tableau Reader](https://www.tableau.com/products/reader)

### Otherwise:

* Here is the link to download and purchase:

The first thing to do after downloading Tableau is connecting a dataset so you can begin to work with the data. Here is the link for all tutorials and the summary of connecting data to Tableau Desktop.
